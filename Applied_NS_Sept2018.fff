We observe that there is an assortative block structure (blocks on the diagonal), but there are also many edges between communities making the true community structure using only connectivity harder to detect. {\bf B.} We performed PCA on the $N \times p$ attribute array and plotted each of the $N$ nodes in two dimensions. Points are colored by their true community assignments, ${\bf z}$. Clustering the nodes according to only connectivity, only attributes, and with the attributed SBM, we quantified the partition accuracy with normalized mutual information, yielding $\text{NMI}({\bf z},\{{\bf z}^{\text{connectivity}}, {\bf z}^{\text{attributes}},{\bf z}^{\text{attribute sbm}}\})=\{0.65,0.68,0.83\}$.}

\caption{{\bf Detectability Analysis in Synthetic Example.} To understand how attribute information can be combined with connectivity to assign nodes to communities accurately, we generated synthetic networks for within-probabilities of $p_{in}$ between 0.05 and 0.3 with corresponding $p_{out}$ or between-community probabilities such that the mean degree of the network was 20. For each of these synthetic networks, we used the attributes from the analysis in figure 2 to fit the attributed SBM. Here, we plot the correctness of the node-to-community assignment with normalized mutual information using the partition obtained from regular SBM (blue) and the partition under the attributed SBM model fit (pink). For each combination of $p_{in}$ and $p_{out}$, we generated 10 networks and hence the bands around the points denote standard deviation. Incorporating attributes with the attributes stochastic block model improves results, particularly near and below the detectability limit, and appears to smooth out the sharp phase transition. }
