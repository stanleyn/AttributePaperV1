We observe that there is an assortative block structure (blocks on the diagonal), but there are also many 'noisy' edges between communities making the true community structure with only a stochastic block model a bit harder to detect. {\bf  B.} We performed PCA on the $N \times p$ dimensional attribute array and plotted each of the $N$ nodes in two dimensions. Points are colored by their true community assignments, ${\bf  z}$. Clustering the nodes according to only connectivity, only attributes, and with the attributed SBM, we quantified the partition accuracy with normalized mutual information.

For each of these synthetic networks, we used the attributes from the analysis in figure 2 to fit the attributed SBM. Here, we plot the correctness of the node-to-community assignment with normalized mutual information using the partition obtained from regular SBM (blue) and the partition under the attributed SBM model fit (pink). For each combination of $p_{in}$ and $p_{out}$, we generated 10 networks and hence the bands around the points denote standard deviation. Incorporating attributes with the attributes stochastic block model shifts the detectability limit slightly to the left. \relax }}{\thepage }{figure.caption.6}}
